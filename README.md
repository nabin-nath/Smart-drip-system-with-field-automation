# Smart-drip-system-with-field-automation
We are here using home automation in the greenhouses to reduce the labour and introducing drip system similar to smart irrigation to keep a check on health of plants


Problem it solves-
1) The work required at greenhouses like turning on/off light at particular time acc to environmental conditions can be done easily with app we built based on the idea of home automation
2) Plants need different kind of medicines acc to temperature variations in their system and this can be done using smart drip system in which our drip will release its fluid after the temperature of plant rises above given criteria
This drip has been shown as motor in the proteus simulation
In the future, thermal vision camera can be added for the best results and good care of plants and crops can be taken with ease



Technologies we used:
Internet of Things, Proteus, Android app development
