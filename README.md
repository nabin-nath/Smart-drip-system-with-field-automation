# Smart-drip-system-with-field-automation

* We are here using home automation in the greenhouses to reduce the labour and introducing drip system similar to smart irrigation to keep a check on health of plants
* This project was developed in order to help farmers take better care of their plants just like mothers take care of their children. A smart drip irrigation system prototype was made using online simulation that injects the required medicinal fluid for the plant on shifting of the temperature of plant above or below a specified range. Moreover, an autonomous system was developed that help the care takers of greenhouses to control the light system using an android app from their locations


## Problem it solves

* The work required at greenhouses like turning on/off light at particular time acc to environmental conditions can be done easily with app we built based on the idea of home automation
* Plants need different kind of medicines acc to temperature variations in their system and this can be done using smart drip system in which our drip will release its fluid after the temperature of plant rises above given criteria
This drip has been shown as motor in the proteus simulation
In the future, thermal vision camera can be added for the best results and good care of plants and crops can be taken with ease



## Technologies we used

- Internet of Things
- Proteus 
- Android app development

## Challenges we faced

Due to unavailability of hardware, online simulation was to be made to show the demo which included a more complex circuit design on Proteus. Using hardware, the circuit will be a little bit different and simple. Moreover, the communication between drip system and control device was not displayed due to online simulation. In brief, integrating both the concepts was difficult in online mode
